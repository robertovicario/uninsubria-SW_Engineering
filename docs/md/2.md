# Petri Nets

_Petri Nets_ are a mathematical modeling language used for the description and analysis of distributed systems. They are particularly useful for representing concurrent, asynchronous, and non-deterministic processes.

---

##Â Structure

- Places: Represent conditions or states.
- Transitions: Represent events that may change the state.
- Arcs: Represent the relationships between places and transitions.
- Tokens: Represent the dynamic state of the system.

---

## Terminology

- When an arc connects a place $P$ to a transition $T$, $P$ is an input place for $T$.
- When an arc connects a place $T$ to a transition $P$: $T$ is an output transition for $P$.

- **Marking:** When tokens are distributed across the places in the net, marking is said to be reached.
- **Enabling:** When all input places of a transition have the required number of tokens, the transition is said to be enabled.
- **Firing:** When an enabled transition is executed, it is said to fire.

---

## Formal Definition

Formally, a Petri net is defined as a 3-tuple $PN = (P, T, F)$ where:

- $P$ is a finite set of places.
- $T$ is a finite set of transitions.
- $F \subseteq (P \times T) \cup (T \times P)$ is a set of arcs.

Moreover, the following conditions must be met:

- $P \cap T = \emptyset$
- $P \cup T \neq \emptyset$
- $F \subseteq (P \times T) \cup (T \times P)$

## Properties

- **Boundedness:** A net is k-bounded if, for some non-negative integer $k$, every place in the net never contains more than $k$ tokens in any reachable marking.
- **Liveness:** A net is live if, from any reachable marking, it is possible to eventually fire any transition.
- **Conservation:** A net is said to be conservative if the total number of tokens in the net remains constant across all reachable markings.
- **Firing Sequences:** A firing sequence is a sequence of transitions that are fired in a specific order. Formally, a firing sequence is a finite sequence of transitions $T_1, T_2, \ldots, T_n$ such that:
- **Equivalence:** Two nets are said to be equivalent if they have the same behavior in terms of reachable markings and firing sequences.

## Network Analysis

- **Reachability Graphs:** A reachability graph is a directed graph that represents all possible markings that can be reached from an initial marking by firing transitions.
- **Matrices-based Analysis:** Incidence Matrix, Pre-incidence Matrix, Post-incidence Matrix.

### Reachability Graphs

Based on two sets:

- E: Markings to be explored.
- U: Markings already explored.

Initially:

- E = {M_0} is initial marking
- U = {} is empty

Algorithm:

while (E is not empty) {
  1. Select a marking M from E
  2. Move M from E to U
  3. For each transition t enabled in M:
     a. Compute the new marking M' by firing t
     b. If M' is not in E or U, add M' to E
}

Covering Marking:

- Given two markings M and M', M' covers M if for every place p in P, M'(p) >= M(p).

### Matrices-based Analysis

- The matrix I, that is the input matrix, is defined as $i_{p, t} = W(<p, t>)$.
- The matrix O, that is the output matrix, is defined as $o_{p, t} = W(<t, p>)$.

## Extensions

1. Inhibitor Arcs: Special arcs that prevent a transition from firing if there are tokens in a specific place.
2. Priority: Mechanisms to assign priorities to transitions, allowing some transitions to fire before others.
3. Timed Nets: Extensions that incorporate timing information into transitions or places.
