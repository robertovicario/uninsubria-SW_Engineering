# Programming Languages

...

There are three main paradigms on which programming languages are based:

- **Procedural Languages**: Focus on a sequence of instructions to perform tasks. An example is _C_.
- **Functional Languages**: Emphasize the use of mathematical functions and avoid changing state or mutable data. An example is _LISP_.
- **Logic Languages**: Based on formal logic, these languages allow for expressing facts and rules about problems within a system of formal logic. An example is _Prolog_.

## Variables

Binding
 Assigning a value to an attribute is
referred to as binding
 Languages may differ from each
other because of
 Number of attributes associated with
entities
 The moment when binding occurs
 At compile– time  Static binding
 At run– time  Dynamic binding

Variables
 In general, a variable is characterized
by the following attributes
 Name
 Scope
 Lifetime
 Value
 Type
